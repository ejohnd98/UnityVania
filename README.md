# UnityVania
This is the repo for the short metroidvania I've been developing, which largely started as a desire to see some music I'd written in a game. I'm definitely a programmer before a musician so it made sense to try.

**Disclaimer:** The code in this project is especially bad in areas.

My time spent on this has been pretty sporadic so I've mostly been in the "game jam" mindset where the resulting code isn't always up to personal standards, but it works. There's numerous things that deserve better planning (like having different classes for each individual menu in the game. ouch) but for the sake of progress won't be touched at the moment.
